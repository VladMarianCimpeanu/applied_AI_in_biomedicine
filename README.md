## Introduction to the problem
Lung diseases are often associated with excruciating pain and suffering as they affect the breathing pattern of the
patient due to suffocation and related symptoms. They are also one of the top causes of death worldwide and include
pneumonia and tuberculosis diseases.

In this project, we are required to develop a classifier able to detect and distinguish signs of *pneumonia* and *tuberculosis* from chest x-ray images.
